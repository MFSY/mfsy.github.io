	abstract = {One of the key step of the EPFL Blue Brain Project data-driven approach to digitally building and simulating the mouse brain involves acquiring, organizing, and integrating heterogenous amounts of data from many sources including neuroscience experiments, published scientific papers, and brain databases. The data describe the structural and functional organization of the brain at various levels (from synapses and subcellular components to individual neurons, circuits, and entire brain regions) and is used to build brain tissue models which can then be disseminated to the neuroscience community. To address many of the challenges raised alongside this iterative cycle, BBP developed and open-sourced Blue Brain Nexus (https://doi.org/10.3233/SW-222974), a data and knowledge management ecosystem of tools based on some of the W3C open and interoperable standards such as RDF, OWL and W3C SHACL. In this presentation, we'll talk about how a large-scale knowledge graph is used at Blue Brain by decentralized domain teams to go beyond high-quality metadata cataloging to handle the diversity and evolution of data at the scale of the whole brain, on the one hand, to track the data provenance as a support for quality assessment, reproducibility and accurate attribution on the other while supporting various other use cases such as data inference and NLP.},

	abstract = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become ubiquitous, created and used by many organisations (from enterprises, research institutions to crowd-sourced open communities) as backbone and driver of many of their intelligent products and applications.

Many KGs such as DBpedia, Microsoft Graph, Google Knowledge Graph, Facebook Social Graph (to name few) have been created to enable and support real world use cases and downstream tasks such as recommendations systems included content-based ones. Leveraging Knowledge graph content, structure and semantics to build an entity recommender system is challenging because of the graph complexity, its high-dimensional and symbolic nature.
However, recent Knowledge graph embeddings approaches have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges. The key idea here is to project KGs entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces simpler to deal with and compute from while preserving (as much as possible) the knowledge graph semantics, structure and entity relative similarities. Equipped with such embeddings, knowledge graph can be projected and deployed into ElasticSearch to build large-scale content-based recommender system.

In this talk, I will give an introduction to Knowledge graph through real world examples, expose the challenges they raise, present different Knowledge graph embeddings techniques and demonstrate how to build, deploy and use them in ElasticSearch for entity content-based entity recommendation and similarity computation.},

	abstract = {Knowledge graphs are more and more core and key components of a modern data management and data science pipeline. In a knowledge graph, a domain of application is broken down into entities (people, organisations, software, workflows, events, etc) connected together by mean of relationships whose semantic are explicit. But most importantly, it allows to:

unify fragmented and unstructured data in a data integration hub,
capture data context,
capture data lineage (provenance),
enforce (meta)data quality.
During this workshop, we will learn how to build, shape up and manage a knowledge graph while ensuring the quality of the data and using Blue Brain Nexus (Github and website), an open source project developed by Blue Brain Project and released under the Apache 2 License.},

	abstract = {Digital data deluge, cross-disciplinary and multi-modal scientific investigations along with tremendous available computing power has led to team based, data-driven and data-intensive methods in science. This come with a set of challenges for collecting, integrating, accessing, using, reusing and preserving heterogenous datasets generated from different contexts. As a data-driven project aiming to build biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the rodent, and ultimately the human brain, the Swiss brain research initiative Blue Brain Project faces also those challenges. To address them we built and open sourced Blue Brain Nexus, a RDF-based Knowledge Graph platform uniquely combining a flexible graph database, a powerful search engine and a scalable data store under a unified declarative and W3C SHACL model driven REST API.},
