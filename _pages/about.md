### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mohameth FranÃ§ois Sy, hailing from [Senegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal), the westernmost country of the African continent mainland also known as [Land of Teraanga](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20201115-teraanga-the-word-that-defines-senegal). Worth a visit :sparkles:.

I've been working in the Data, Semantic Web and knowledge Graph engineering fields for more than 12 years now both in France and Switzerland. First as a researcher in France (PhD at [Ecole des Mines d'AlÃ¨s](https://www.imt-mines-ales.fr/en) and Postdoctoral Fellow at [Grenoble LIG Lab](https://www.liglab.fr/en)) and then for 9+ years as a system engineer and engineering team lead at Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne ([EPFL,  in Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/blue-brain/people/group-leaders/mohameth-francois-sy)).

I've contributed to and led many FAIR Data and Knowledge Graph products projects from building to production deployment both in academic and industry contexts.

You'll find a selected list of [projects](./projects) and [publications](./publications) I contributed to as well as [talks](./talks) I gave in various event types such as meetups and workshops.
